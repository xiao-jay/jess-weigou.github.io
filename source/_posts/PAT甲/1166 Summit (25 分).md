### <font size=6px>Summit</font>

#### 题目描述：

A **summit** (峰会) is a meeting of heads of state or government. Arranging the rest areas for the summit is not a simple job. The ideal arrangement of one area is to invite those heads so that everyone is a direct friend of everyone.

Now given a set of tentative arrangements, your job is to tell the organizers whether or not each area is all set.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers N (≤ 200), the number of heads in the summit, and M, the number of friendship relations. Then M lines follow, each gives a pair of indices of the heads who are friends to each other. The heads are indexed from 1 to N.

Then there is another positive integer K (≤ 100), and K lines of tentative arrangement of rest areas follow, each first gives a positive number L (≤ N), then followed by a sequence of L distinct indices of the heads. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

### Output Specification:

For each of the K areas, print in a line your advice in the following format:

- if in this area everyone is a direct friend of everyone, and no friend is missing (that is, no one else is a direct friend of everyone in this area), print `Area X is OK.`.
- if in this area everyone is a direct friend of everyone, yet there are some other heads who may also be invited without breaking the ideal arrangement, print `Area X may invite more people, such as H.` where `H` is the smallest index of the head who may be invited.
- if in this area the arrangement is not an ideal one, then print `Area X needs help.` so the host can provide some special service to help the heads get to know each other.

Here `X` is the index of an area, starting from 1 to `K`.

### Sample Input:

```in
8 10
5 6
7 8
6 4
3 6
4 5
2 3
8 2
2 7
5 3
3 4
6
4 5 4 3 6
3 2 8 7
2 2 3
1 1
2 4 6
3 3 2 1
```

### Sample Output:

```out
Area 1 is OK.
Area 2 is OK.
Area 3 is OK.
Area 4 is OK.
Area 5 may invite more people, such as 3.
Area 6 needs help.
```

#### 思路:

想了半天还不知道要用什么算法，原来是个暴力模拟题。

#### 代码:

```go
#include "iostream"
#include "string.h"
using  namespace std;


int rela[201][201];
int main(){
    int m,n,k;
    int head[201];
    cin >>m>>n;
    memset(rela,0,sizeof(rela));
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        int a,b;
        cin >>a>>b;
        rela[a][b] = rela[b][a] = 1;
    }
    cin >>k;
    int index = 0;
    while(k--){
        index++;
        int p;
        bool flag = false;
        memset(head, 0 ,sizeof (head));
        cin >>p;
        int num[p+1];
        for(int i=0;i<p;i++){
            cin >>num[i];
            head[num[i]] = 1;
        }
        // 开始暴力模拟
        for(int i=0;i<p && !flag;i++){
            for(int j=i+1;j<p;j++){
                if(rela[num[i]][num[j]] != 1){
                    cout << "Area "<< index<<" needs help."<<endl;
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (flag ) continue;
        else{
            // 开始判断是否有额外的数字可以加入
            for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
                if(head[i] != 1){
                    for (int j=0; j<p;j++){
                        if(rela[num[j]][i] != 1){
                            flag = true;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    if(!flag){
                        cout <<"Area "<< index<<" may invite more people, such as "<<i<<"."<<endl;
                        flag = true;
                        break;
                    }else{
                        flag = false;
                    }
                }
            }
            if(!flag){
                cout << "Area "<< index<<" is OK."<<endl;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
