### <font size=6px>Lowest Common Ancestor</font>

#### 题目描述：

The lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes U and V in a tree is the deepest node that has both U and V as descendants.

A binary search tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given any two nodes in a BST, you are supposed to find their LCA.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives two positive integers: M (≤ 1,000), the number of pairs of nodes to be tested; and N (≤ 10,000), the number of keys in the BST, respectively. In the second line, N distinct integers are given as the preorder traversal sequence of the BST. Then M lines follow, each contains a pair of integer keys U and V. All the keys are in the range of **int**.

### Output Specification:

For each given pair of U and V, print in a line `LCA of U and V is A.` if the LCA is found and `A` is the key. But if `A` is one of U and V, print `X is an ancestor of Y.` where `X` is `A` and `Y` is the other node. If U or V is not found in the BST, print in a line `ERROR: U is not found.` or `ERROR: V is not found.` or `ERROR: U and V are not found.`.

### Sample Input:

```in
6 8
6 3 1 2 5 4 8 7
2 5
8 7
1 9
12 -3
0 8
99 99
```

### Sample Output:

```out
LCA of 2 and 5 is 3.
8 is an ancestor of 7.
ERROR: 9 is not found.
ERROR: 12 and -3 are not found.
ERROR: 0 is not found.
ERROR: 99 and 99 are not found.
```

#### 思路:

找到公共祖先，可以指向一个father节点，从下往上遍历，第二个数遍历的时候如果发现有个节点已经被访问了，就可以判断这个就是最小公共节点。

#### 代码:

```go
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>
using namespace std;
map<int, bool> mp;
int main() {
    int m, n, u, v, a;
    scanf("%d %d", &m, &n);
    vector<int> pre(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &pre[i]);
        mp[pre[i]] = true;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            a = pre[j];
            if ((a >= u && a <= v) || (a >= v && a <= u)) break;
        } 
        if (mp[u] == false && mp[v] == false)
            printf("ERROR: %d and %d are not found.\n", u, v);
        else if (mp[u] == false || mp[v] == false)
            printf("ERROR: %d is not found.\n", mp[u] == false ? u : v);
        else if (a == u || a == v)
            printf("%d is an ancestor of %d.\n", a, a == u ? v : u);
        else
            printf("LCA of %d and %d is %d.\n", u, v, a);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
