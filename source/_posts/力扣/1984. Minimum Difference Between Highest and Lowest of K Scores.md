### <font size=6px>Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores</font>

#### 题目描述：

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.


Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

#### 思路:

排序一下就行

#### 代码:

```golang
func minimumDifference(nums []int, k int) int {
    n := len(nums)
    if len(nums) == 1{
        return 0
    }
    sort.Ints(nums)
    minNum := 999999
    for i:=0;i<n-k+1;i++{
        minNum = min(minNum, nums[i+k-1]-nums[i])
    }
    return minNum
}

func min(a, b int)int{
    if a>b{
        return b 
    }else{
        return a
    }

}
```
